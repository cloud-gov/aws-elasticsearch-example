# aws-elasticsearch-example [Work in progress]

## About

This repository has a series of examples for migrating your cloud.gov applications
from using the `elasticsearch56` service running on the `medium-ha` and `medium` plans to the
`elasticsearch-aws` service running on the `aws-elasticsearch-prod` and `aws-elasticsearch-dev` plans powered by
[AWS Elastisearch](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/). The new AWS Elasticsearch services provides customers with access the Elasticsearch v7.4; upgrading the current Elasticsearch offering from v5.4.

## Examples

The following is a list of different language examples for connecting and using the updated Elasticsearch service
offering which leverages AWS Elasticsearch.
